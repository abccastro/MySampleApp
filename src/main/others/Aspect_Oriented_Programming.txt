Aspect-Oriented Programming
- programming technique based on concept of an Aspect
- aspect encapsulates cross-cutting logic

Aspects
- can be reused at multiple locations
- can be applied based on configuration

AOP Solution
- apply the proxy design pattern

Use Cases: logging, security, transactions
> audit logging, exception handling, API management

Advantages
- reusable modules
- resolve code tangling
- resolve code scatter
- applied selectively based on configuration

Disadvantages
- too many aspects and app flow is hard to follow
- minor performance cost for aspect execution (run-time weaving)
