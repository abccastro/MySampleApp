Hibernate
- a framework for persisting / saving Java objects in a database
- handles all of the low-level SQL; minimizes the JDBC code to develop
- provides ORM (Object-to-Relational Mapping)

JPA (Jakarta Persistence API)
- standard API for ORM
- only a specification (most popular: hibernate)
    > defines a set of interfaces
    > requires an implementation to be usable
- not locked to vendor's implementation

Note:
- Hibernate/JPA uses JDBC for all database communications
- JPA Entity Manager responsible for saving/retrieving entities
    > EntityManager: low-level control or flexibility
    > JPARepository: high-level of abstraction

Entity Class
- java class mapped to a database table
- must be annotated with @Entity
- must have a public or protected no-argument constructor
